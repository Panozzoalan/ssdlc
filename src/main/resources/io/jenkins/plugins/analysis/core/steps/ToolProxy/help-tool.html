    For each static analysis tool a dedicated parser or scanner will be used to read report files or produce issues in
    any other way. If your tool is not yet supported you can define a new Groovy based parser in Jenkins
    system configuration. You can reference this new parser afterwards when you select the tool 'Groovy Parser'.
    Additionally, you provide a new parser within a new small plug-in. If the parser is useful for other teams
    as well please share it and provide pull requests for the
    <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/pulls">Warnings Next Generation Plug-in</a> and
    the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model/pulls">Analysis Parsers Library</a>.

    The results of the selected tool are published using a unique ID (i.e. URL) which must not be already used by
    another tool in this job. This ID is used as link to the results, so choose a short and meaningful name. 
    If you leave the ID field empty, then the built-in default ID of the registered tool will be used.

<p>
    You can also override the display name of the tool. This name is used in details views, trend captions, and hyper
    links. If you leave the name field empty, then the built-in default name of the registered tool will be used.
